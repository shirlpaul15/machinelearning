**Background**

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).


**Introduction**

This is the final project of the practical machine learning course conducted by John Hopkins University. The goal of your project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. The total number of participants are six. Further we will be using a Prediction model to predict 20 different test cases. The software used for the analysis is R version 3.3.0. 



**Data Source**
The data for the project was taken from http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. 
More information on the same can be found here. 
The training data for this project are available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv and The test data are available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv. 

For the analysis, we are splitting the data into Training set and Testing set in the ratio 60:40. The training set consists of 11776 observations and 160 variables and the total number of observations in testing test are 7846 and 160 variables. 
To get better results we are cleaning the data before the main analysis. For this purpose, we removed all the variables with the near zero variances, removed the ID column and removed the variables with too many missing values (We removed the variables which have more than 60% missing values). The same was done for the test set too. In the end we were left with 11776 observations and 58 variables in the training set and 20 observations and 57 variables in the test data.

library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(rattle)
library(randomForest)

Finally, load the same seed with the following line of code:

set.seed(12345)
Getting the data
The training data set can be found on the following URL:

trainUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"
The testing data set can be found on the following URL:

testUrl <- "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv"
Procedure 1) assumes that you only want to store the data files in memory.

Load data to memory solely

training <- read.csv(url(trainUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
testing <- read.csv(url(testUrl), na.strings=c("NA","#DIV/0!",""))
Procedure 2) assumes that you want to store the data files in memory and on disk. (Thus, it involves downloading data directly to your hard drive.)


**getDataFiles("/data")** 
Partioning the training set into two
Partioning Training data set into two data sets, 60% for myTraining, 40% for myTesting:

inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=training$classe, p=0.6, list=FALSE)
myTraining <- training[inTrain, ]; myTesting <- training[-inTrain, ]
dim(myTraining); dim(myTesting)
## [1] 11776   160
## [1] 7846  160
Cleaning the data
The following transformations were used to clean the data:

Transformation 1: Cleaning NearZeroVariance Variables Run this code to view possible NZV Variables:

myDataNZV <- nearZeroVar(myTraining, saveMetrics=TRUE)
Run this code to create another subset without NZV variables:

myNZVvars <- names(myTraining) %in% c("new_window", "kurtosis_roll_belt", "kurtosis_picth_belt",
"kurtosis_yaw_belt", "skewness_roll_belt", "skewness_roll_belt.1", "skewness_yaw_belt",
"max_yaw_belt", "min_yaw_belt", "amplitude_yaw_belt", "avg_roll_arm", "stddev_roll_arm",
"var_roll_arm", "avg_pitch_arm", "stddev_pitch_arm", "var_pitch_arm", "avg_yaw_arm",
"stddev_yaw_arm", "var_yaw_arm", "kurtosis_roll_arm", "kurtosis_picth_arm",
"kurtosis_yaw_arm", "skewness_roll_arm", "skewness_pitch_arm", "skewness_yaw_arm",
"max_roll_arm", "min_roll_arm", "min_pitch_arm", "amplitude_roll_arm", "amplitude_pitch_arm",
"kurtosis_roll_dumbbell", "kurtosis_picth_dumbbell", "kurtosis_yaw_dumbbell", "skewness_roll_dumbbell",
"skewness_pitch_dumbbell", "skewness_yaw_dumbbell", "max_yaw_dumbbell", "min_yaw_dumbbell",
"amplitude_yaw_dumbbell", "kurtosis_roll_forearm", "kurtosis_picth_forearm", "kurtosis_yaw_forearm",
"skewness_roll_forearm", "skewness_pitch_forearm", "skewness_yaw_forearm", "max_roll_forearm",
"max_yaw_forearm", "min_roll_forearm", "min_yaw_forearm", "amplitude_roll_forearm",
"amplitude_yaw_forearm", "avg_roll_forearm", "stddev_roll_forearm", "var_roll_forearm",
"avg_pitch_forearm", "stddev_pitch_forearm", "var_pitch_forearm", "avg_yaw_forearm",
"stddev_yaw_forearm", "var_yaw_forearm")
myTraining <- myTraining[!myNZVvars]
#To check the new N?? of observations
dim(myTraining)
## [1] 11776   100
Transformation 2: Killing first column of Dataset - ID Removing first ID variable so that it does not interfer with ML Algorithms:

myTraining <- myTraining[c(-1)]
Transformation 3: Cleaning Variables with too many NAs. For Variables that have more than a 60% threshold of NA's I'm going to leave them out:

trainingV3 <- myTraining #creating another subset to iterate in loop
for(i in 1:length(myTraining)) { #for every column in the training dataset
        if( sum( is.na( myTraining[, i] ) ) /nrow(myTraining) >= .6 ) { #if n?? NAs > 60% of total observations
        for(j in 1:length(trainingV3)) {
            if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(trainingV3)[j]) ) ==1)  { #if the columns are the same:
                trainingV3 <- trainingV3[ , -j] #Remove that column
            }   
        } 
    }
}
#To check the new N?? of observations
dim(trainingV3)
## [1] 11776    58
#Seting back to our set:
myTraining <- trainingV3
rm(trainingV3)
Now let us do the exact same 3 transformations but for our myTesting and testing data sets.

clean1 <- colnames(myTraining)
clean2 <- colnames(myTraining[, -58]) #already with classe column removed
myTesting <- myTesting[clean1]
testing <- testing[clean2]

#To check the new N?? of observations
dim(myTesting)
## [1] 7846   58
#To check the new N?? of observations
dim(testing)
## [1] 20 57
#Note: The last column - problem_id - which is not equal to training sets, was also "automagically" removed
#No need for this code:
#testing <- testing[-length(testing)]
In order to ensure proper functioning of Decision Trees and especially RandomForest Algorithm with the Test data set (data set provided), we need to coerce the data into the same type.

for (i in 1:length(testing) ) {
        for(j in 1:length(myTraining)) {
        if( length( grep(names(myTraining[i]), names(testing)[j]) ) ==1)  {
            class(testing[j]) <- class(myTraining[i])
        }      
    }      
}
#And to make sure Coertion really worked, simple smart ass technique:
testing <- rbind(myTraining[2, -58] , testing) #note row 2 does not mean anything, this will be removed right.. now:
testing <- testing[-1,]

modFitA1 <- rpart(classe ~ ., data=myTraining, method="class")
Note: to view the decision tree with fancy run this command:

fancyRpartPlot(modFitA1)

Random Forests yielded better Results, as expected!

Generating Files to submit as answers for the Assignment:
Finally, using the provided Test Set: Note: #For Decision Tree would be like this, but not going to use it: #predictionsA2 <- predict(modFitA1, testing, type = "class")

For Random Forests is, which yielded a much better prediction:

predictionsB2 <- predict(modFitB1, testing, type = "class")
